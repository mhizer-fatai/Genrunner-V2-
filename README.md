## 🏎️ The Game

Set against a backdrop of scrolling grids and CRT scanlines, GenRunner 2 is a test of reflexes and endurance.

*   **Genre:** Retro-Futuristic Endless Racer / Survival.
*   **Aesthetic:** Stark Monochrome with Neon Accents (Yellow/Red/Blue), inspired by 80s arcade cabinets and modern cyberpunk UI.
*   **The Goal:** Survive. Speed increases indefinitely. Traffic is relentless. One crash, and you are out.

## 🤝 Community & Multiplayer

Unlike standard single-player infinite runners, GenRunner 2 is built to be played **together**.

### 1. The Lobby System
The heart of the community experience. Up to **30 players** can join a single room.
*   **Discord Integration:** Players identify themselves via their community handles.
*   **Synchronized Starts:** The Host controls the grid. Everyone launches at the exact same moment.

### 2. Live "Battle Royale" Leaderboards
While you drive alone on your screen, you are racing against the ghosts of everyone in your lobby.
*   **Real-time Rankings:** See who is ahead of you in meters instantly via the HUD.
*   **Live Feed:** Get notified immediately when an opponent crashes or overtakes you.

### 3. Spectator Mode
This is where the community magic happens.
*   **Permadeath (Per Round):** When you crash, your run is over.
*   **Watch the Survivors:** You are immediately transitioned to a Spectator View where you watch the remaining drivers fight for 1st place.
*   **Cheer & Jeer:** Perfect for streaming or Discord calls, as the group whittles down to the final winner.
