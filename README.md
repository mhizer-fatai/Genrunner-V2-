While you drive alone on your screen, you are racing against the ghosts of everyone in your lobby.
*   **Real-time Rankings:** See who is ahead of you in meters instantly via the HUD.
*   **Live Feed:** Get notified immediately when an opponent crashes or overtakes you.

### 3. Spectator Mode
This is where the community magic happens.
